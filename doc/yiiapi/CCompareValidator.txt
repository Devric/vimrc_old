*CCompareValidator*   >> |CValidator| >> |CComponent|
===================

 CCompareValidator compares the specified attribute value with another value
 and validates if they are equal.

 The value being compared with can be another attribute value (specified via
 |CCompareValidator::compareAttribute|) or a constant (specified via
 |CCompareValidator::compareValue|. When both are specified, the latter takes
 precedence. If neither is specified, the attribute will be compared with
 another attribute whose name is by appending "_repeat" to the source
 attribute name.

 The comparison can be either |CCompareValidator::strict| or not.

 Starting from version 1.0.8, CCompareValidator supports different comparison
 operators. Previously, it only compares to see if two values are equal or
 not.


PROPERTY DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<allowEmpty>				*CCompareValidator::allowEmpty*
 (boolean) whether the attribute value can be null or empty. Defaults to
 false. If this is true, it means the attribute is considered valid when it is
 empty.

<compareAttribute>			*CCompareValidator::compareAttribute*
 (string) the name of the attribute to be compared with

<compareValue>				*CCompareValidator::compareValue*
 (string) the constant value to be compared with

<operator>				*CCompareValidator::operator*
 (string) the operator for comparison. Defaults to '='. The followings are
 valid operators:
   '=' or '==': validates to see if the two values are equal. If
   |CCompareValidator::strict| is true, the comparison will be done
   in strict mode (i.e. checking value type as well).
   '!=': validates to see if the two values are NOT equal. If
   |CCompareValidator::strict| is true, the comparison will be done
   in strict mode (i.e. checking value type as well).
   '>': validates to see if the value being validated is greater than
   the value being compared with.
   '>=': validates to see if the value being validated is greater
   than or equal to the value being compared with.
   '<': validates to see if the value being validated is less than
   the value being compared with.
   '<=': validates to see if the value being validated is less than
   or equal to the value being compared with.

<strict>				*CCompareValidator::strict*
 (boolean) whether the comparison is strict (both value and type must be the
 same.) Defaults to false.



METHOD DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*CCompareValidator::clientValidateAttribute*			 public
>
 clientValidateAttribute($object, $attribute)
<
(string) the client-side validation script.

 Returns the JavaScript needed for performing client-side validation.
    [object] (CModel) the data object being validated
    [attribute] (string) the name of the attribute to be validated.


*CCompareValidator::validateAttribute*				 protected
>
 validateAttribute($object, $attribute)
<
(void)

 Validates the attribute of the object. If there is any error, the error
 message is added to the object.
    [object] (CModel) the object being validated
    [attribute] (string) the attribute being validated
